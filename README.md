# MachineLearning

- RealEstateForecasting contains an encoded XGBoost regression model (trained with randomized grid search and 5-fold cross-validation) and an IPython notebook that implements code for predicting 2021 full cash values from 2016-19 and 2020 data in the Tuscon, Arizona real estate market (test root mean squared error of $14,326 for our dataset of 101,661 homes).

- CostEffectiveMaintenance.ipynb contains code that exhibits data wrangling/feature engineering skills, and trains an XGBoost classifier to determine whether corporate truck maintenances from a real-life dataset (hosted on a MySQL server) are either cost-effective or cost-ineffective.

- KNearestNeighbors.ipynb contains code that implements, from scratch, a two-dimensional k-nearest neighbors regression algorithm.

- LinearRegression.ipynb contains code that implements a linear regression, from scratch, without using scikit-learn.
